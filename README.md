# FINALS
During this time, I was already stressed out since Arrays was the first one to be studied and on my own nontheless.

# Program 1 - Bus Seat Reservation
This Java program utilizes the use of arrays. It takes the input of the user where they determine which row and column they want to reserve a seat in.

# Program 2 - KineticEnergy
In this Java program, I used an addition function within the program for the first time in order to calculate Kinetic Energy!

# Program 3 - GenshinQuiz
This was my final Task Performance for my 1st Year 1st Semester. I used everything I've learned so far throughout the year such as functions, arrays, and control structures. It was pretty fun!
